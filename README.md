### NTRUEncrypt: im in ur quantum box, maybe
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

This is a straight forward port of the NTRUEncrypt reference implementation by
Security Innovation Inc.  The Java implementation was used as the basis for most
of the port as it has better test cases.

The algorithm itself is PATENT ENCUMBERED, however there is a irrevocable grant
for use in "Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)".  Please contact Security
Innovation Inc. regarding commercial licensing.

The original reference impementation itself is licenced under the GPLv2 or later,
along with the same "FOSS Licence Exception" that covers most popular FOSS licenses.

Implementor's Notes:
 * Do not contact me about licensing/patent questions.
